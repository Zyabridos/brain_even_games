## Demonstraition of games:
  Алксандр, у меня не получилось вставить видео в файл README, чтобы оно работало. Что не так? И насчет оформления команд не поняла - линт не ругается, на Гите все выделено.
Below is presented demonstration of the games. You can see examples of each game, by clicking on name of the game you want to be demonstrated.
