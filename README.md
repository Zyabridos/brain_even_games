## Description of the project
This project was created to play simple mathematical games. The package contains 5 games, each game has three rounds. Main rule for all games is the same - in order to succeed, player would have to give three right answer in a row. Otherwise, game considered lost. Specific rules for each game will be provided after greeting of player in each game.
## Minimum system requirements
Minimum system requirements: a computer, produced in this century and a keybord.
## Setup
In order to setup the game, a player should run 'make install' command in a command line

## Play

  1. "Brain even" is a game, where a player should determine if a given number is even or not. In order to play the game, write "brain-even" in your console.
  2. "Brain calculation" is a game, where a mathematical expression is showed to a player. In order to play the game, write "brain-calc" in your console. 
  3. "Brain Greatest Common Divider" is a game, target of which is to find greatest common divider of two given numbers. In order to play the game, write "brain-gcd" in your console. 
  4. "Brain Progression" is a game, which shows a player sequence of 10 numbers, where one is missing. Player should determine missing number. In order to play the game, write "brain-progression" in your console. 
  5. "Brain-prime" is a game, purpose of which is to find out if a given number is prime. In order to play the game, write "brain-prime" in your console.
